# Arduino-Reaction-time
An Arduino project to create a circuit to measure the participants response time to a lighted diode.

Based on the same  circuits previously used with a Raspberry Pi the Arduino is used to read the time taken to hit a switch following the illumination of a diode.
We make 2 examples, with different layouts each capable of comparing reaction times of different participants
with the  intention of creating a competetive game in participants can compare their results.
